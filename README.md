# Supply-chain

This is a supply chain dataset containing both numerical and categorical columns. I have performed some data preprocessing steps before moving on to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. In this project, I have created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to answer questions from the data. For instance, i have determined the product type that generates the most revenue and which supplies incur the highest transportation costs. i also used the  group-by functions and pivot tables to analyze the data.
